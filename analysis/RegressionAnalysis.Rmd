load("data/.RData")
```

A quick check of the imputed Lot Frontage values before we begin.

```{r imputationcheck, echo=FALSE}
housePrices_imputed_new <- housePrices_imputed %>%
                            filter(Neighborhood %in% c("NAmes", "BrkSide", "Edwards"))

housePrices_imputed_new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=LotFrontage, y=SalePrice, color=any_missing)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Lot Frontage", y = "Price", color = "Missingness", title = "Price vs Frontage")

```







We fit a regression model to get the following output:

```{r modelfit, echo=FALSE}
housePrices_imputed_new %>%
  lm(formula = SalePrice ~ GrLivArea + Neighborhood + Neighborhood*GrLivArea) %>%
  summary()

```
